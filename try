This challenge is pretty simple. The binary is checking to see if the environment variable "test1234" exists, and if it's set equal to the current $USER environment variable.

export test1234=$USER
./shiba2
happynootnoises



find /* | grep shiba4.
achado: 
/etc/shiba/shiba4
/opt/secret/shiba4

/opt/secret/shiba4
test1234

cd /opt/secret/shiba4
./shiba4
test1234


sudo -u jen whoami
